## Getting started
Welcome to [CoreNodes](https://core-nodes.ru/)!

## 1. Sign into the dashboard
Head to [core-nodes.ru](https://core-nodes.ru/) and sign into the dashboard with your email and password or use Discord account or magic link.

If you haven't created an account yet, click **Create an Account** or **Discord** and follow the instructions

### 2. Create a server
Click **Create Server** and select the game you'd need to deploy. ou can also select the region you’d like the server to be in, alongside the resources (CPU, RAM, Storage) you’d like the server to have. By default, you’ll get 4GB RAM, 1.5 CPU cores and 30GB of storage.

### 3. Use the Panel
Unlike other hosts, our panel is built into the dashboard. Once your server is created, you can find it in the Servers tab. You can then use the panel to manage your server, view the console, edit files and more.
